### PowerCLI functions for use in VMware environments

This is a repository to hold miscellaneous functions that I find useful in day-to-day VMware administration. They depend on [PowerCLI], a collection of official PowerShell modules provided by VMware to interact with VMware products.

Code here may include comment blocks at the top following the conventions of the [PowerShell Gallery], VMware's [PowerCLI Community Repository], or both.

I have published `Get-VMotion` on the PowerShell Gallery; if you have PowerShell 5.0 or greater, you can use `Save-Script` or `Install-Script` to download the latest version.

All scripts are available "as is," and are run at your own risk in a production environment.
