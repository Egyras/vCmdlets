### PowerCLI functions for use in VMware environments

This is a repository to hold my personal contributions to VMware's [PowerCLI Community Repository][PCR], as well as other small functions that I find useful in day-to-day VMware administration.

Most cmdlets here will include conventions of that repository, such as the opening comment block of basic information independent of comment-based help.

[PowerCLI] is a collection of official PowerShell modules provided by VMware to interact with VMware products.

All scripts are available as is, and are run at your own risk in a production environment.
